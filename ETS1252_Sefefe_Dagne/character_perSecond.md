### Problem Analysis
1. Input: The user provides the file size in bytes.
2. Process: 
    - Calculate the time required to transmit the file in seconds.
    - Convert the transmission time from seconds into days, hours, minutes, and seconds.
3. Output: Display the time required to transmit the file in days, hours, minutes, and seconds.

### Pseudocode
`
1. Start
2. Define a constant RateofTransmission with value 960
3. Declare variables:
    - fileSize (double)
    - transmissionTimeInSeconds (double)
    - days, hours, minutes, seconds (integers)
4. Prompt the user to enter the file size in bytes
5. Read the fileSize from user input
6. Calculate the transmissionTimeInSeconds as:
    transmissionTimeInSeconds = fileTimeInSeconds to days, hours, minutes, and seconds:
    - days = transmissionTimeInSeconds / 86400
    - hours = (transmissionTimeInSeconds - (days * 86400)) / 3600
    - minutes = (transmissionTimeInSeconds - (days * 86400) - (hours * 3600))InSeconds - (days * 86400) - (hours * 3600) - (minutes * 60)
8. Display the result:
    "It will take <days> days, <hours> hours, <minutes> minutes, and <seconds> seconds to transmit the file."
9. End
