  ### Algorithm(pseudocode)
### 1.Start

### 2.Print the First Pattern

Print "Pattern 1: A 5x5 grid of numbers from 1 to 5"

Loop i from 1 to 5

Loop j from 1 to 5

Print j followed by a space

Print a newline

### 3.Print the Second Pattern

Print "Pattern 2: A 4x6 grid of letters from A to X"

Initialize letter to 'A'

Loop i from 0 to 3

Loop j from 0 to 5

Print letter followed by a space

Increment letter

Print a newline

### 4.Print the Third Pattern

Print "Pattern 3: A right-angled triangle of numbers"

Loop i from 1 to 5

Loop j from 1 to i

Print j followed by a space

Print a newline

### 5.End
