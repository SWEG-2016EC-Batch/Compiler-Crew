### Problem Analysis
The purpose of this program is to calculate the result of a base number raised to a power (exponent) using the pow function from the cmath library. 

Inputs:
- x: The base number.
- y: The exponent to which the base number is raised.

Processes:
- Read the base number x from the user.
- Read the exponent y from the user.
- Calculate the result of raising x to the power of y using the formula: final_result = pow(x, y).

Outputs:
- Display the result of the calculation.
